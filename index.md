    Hippo Soccer Royale (working title) is a work-in-progress that I'm actively working on (quite possibly as you're reading this). It is a whimsical little minigame loosely inspired by the classic tabletop game "Hungry Hungry Hippos", except the player is a cute tiny hippo knocking marbles into their goal while preventing others from scoring in theirs.<br>
	I plan to add Menus, UI, AI computer players, a highscores board, and a lot of polish (in the form of asset store props, particle effects, sound, and shader effects).<br><br>
	Making this playable in a browser window required building it in WebGL form and pushing the build to the repository for this site. You can find this project on my github here:<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/EKramer567/HippoSoccerRoyale">Hippo Royale Repository</a><br>
	WASD to control, or it should work with a controller (does not yet work on mobile)

    This is my attempt at a quadcopter simulator. I made this with Unity using C#, and no plugins or asset store assets. Making this playable in a browser window required building it in WebGL form and pushing the build to the repository for this site. You can find this project on my github here: 
    <a href="https://github.com/EKramer567/Quadcopter-Simulator">Quadcopter Simulator Repository</a><br><br>
                                                   
I made this several years ago, but I may come back to this project at a later date to clean it up and polish it.<br>

    <h1>Hero Landing!</h1>
    <img src="HLscreenshot.png" width="300" height="475"><br>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.EKramer.HeroEntranceTraining" class="button">Go to Google Play Page</a>
</div>
<div style="background-color:#444444; padding:10px;"> 
<p align="center">
<i>Hero Landing!</i> is a small mobile game that I completed and published to the Google Play Store myself. I made this with Unity using C#. I used plugins for ads and microtransactions, and SFX/Music from the asset store. I chose to keep its repository private, since it is a monetized published game. If you'd like to see some snippets of the code that went in to <i>Hero Landing!</i>, please email me and I can get those for you.
Note, this is an old project of mine that has since fallen off the app store. I do still have the project and I could put it back up (I still have the game on my phone, actually), but I'm prioritizing newer projects at the moment.
