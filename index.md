    <h1>Quadcopter Simulator</h1>
    <img src="QuadcopterSimPic.png"><br>
<a href="/assets/unity/Quadcoptersim/index.html" class="button">Play</a>
</div>

<div style="background-color:#444444; padding:10px;">

    This is my attempt at a quadcopter simulator, using a USB/Bluetooth controller. I made this with Unity using C#, and no plugins or asset store assets. At the moment, you can only control the copter with the USB controller, but for the moment I just want to get this up here. You can find the project on my github here: 
    <a href="https://github.com/EKramer567/Quadcopter-Simulator">LINK</a><br><br>
                                                   
Before I move on to my next project, I want to fix one bug that I've been trying to fix for a while: if the copter's Yaw goes near 180 degrees relative to its starting rotation, <i>the PID balancing makes the copter flip out unexpectedly</i>. I think I will also mess around with the terrain tool and maybe get some free tree assets to put in there just to make it look a bit better. Eventually I want to figure out how to allow the use of WebVR on these pages.

    <h1>Hero Landing!</h1>

<div style="background-color:#444444; padding:10px;"> 
<p align="center">
<i>Hero Landing!</i> is a small mobile game that I completed and published to the Google Play Store myself. I made this with Unity using C#. I used plugins for ads and microtransactions, and SFX/Music from the asset store. I chose to keep its repository private, since it is a monetized published game. If you'd like to see some snippets of the code that went in to <i>Hero Landing!</i>, please email me and I can get those for you.
