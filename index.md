    Greetings, and welcome to my site!
    Below is a compilation of projects I have completed and some I am currently working on.

    <style>
.centerAlignObject{
        text-align: center;
        }
a.button {
    background-color: #64B70E; /* Green */
    border: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 15px 32px;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;

    <h1>Quadcopter Simulator</h1>
    <img src="QuadcopterSimPic.png"><br>
<a href="/assets/unity/Quadcoptersim/index.html" class="button">Play</a>
</div>

    This is my attempt at a quadcopter simulator, using a USB/Bluetooth controller. At the moment, you can only control the copter with the USB controller, but for the moment I just want to get this up here. You can find the project on my github here: 
    <a href="https://github.com/EKramer567/Quadcopter-Simulator">LINK</a><br>
                                                   
Before I move on to my next project, I'm going to add keyboard controls for the sake of this site, and I want to fix one bug that I've been trying to fix forever: if the copter's Yaw goes near 180 degrees relative to its starting rotation, <i>the PID balancing makes the copter flip out unexpectedly</i>. I think I will also mess around with the terrain tool and maybe get some free tree assets to put in there just to make it look a bit better. Eventually I want to figure out how to allow the use of WebVR on these pages.
